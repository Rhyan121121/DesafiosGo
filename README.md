# Go Challenges

This repository contains Go programs that solve different programming challenges. Each challenge is implemented in its own file or folder. Below are the available challenges and instructions for running them.

## Challenge 1: Temperature Converter

A Go program that performs temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The user chooses the input scale and gets the converted values in the other two scales.

**How to run:**

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the `Challenge1` directory.
3. Run the command:
   ```bash
   go run ConversionChallenge.go
   ```

**How to use:**
- Choose the input temperature scale:
  - 1 for Celsius
  - 2 for Fahrenheit
  - 3 for Kelvin
  - 4 to exit
- Enter the desired temperature value.
- The program will show the conversions to the other scales.
- Press Enter to continue or choose to exit.

## Challenge 2: Divisibles By 3

A Go program that prints all numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 3.

**How to run:**

1. Navigate to the `Challenges2` directory.
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   go run DivisiblesBy3.go
   ```

## Challenge 2: PinPan

A Go program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, but prints "Pin" for numbers divisible by 3, "Pan" for numbers divisible by 5, and the number itself otherwise.

**How to run:**

1. Navigate to the `Challenges2` directory.
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   go run PinPan.go
   ```
